Teach yourself how to create good Claude Code skills by reading everything in @docs, take your time, Our goal will be to improve existing skill further.
Understand very well how to create Claude Code skills:
[create_new_skill-process.md](docs/create_new_skill-process.md)
[anthropic-skill-docs](docs/knowledge/anthropic-skill-docs)

Also note [important.md](important.md) and make sure to follow what it says.

- The skill we're improving is [approval-tests](output_skills/approval-tests) for python.

Once you're ready, you can analyze what's currently in the skill and make yourself a plan of how to improve it further (you can use todo tool you have you create a temporary todo file in the root), taking into account best practices of creating Claude Code skills and important considerations from context management as a guidance.

You can teach yourself more about python approvaltests by using resources in [links.md](output_skills/approval-tests/links.md)

Once you have an imporvement plan, work through it and implement until you see no more things to improve. Take your time, we're not rushing, the goal is to make it really really good.

Commit every improvement as a separate commit.
