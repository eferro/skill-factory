Teach yourself how to create good Claude Code skills by reading everything in @docs, take your time, Our goal will be to improve existing skill further.
Understand very well how to create Claude Code skills:
[create_new_skill-process.md](docs/create_new_skill-process.md)
[anthropic-skill-docs](docs/knowledge/anthropic-skill-docs)

Also note [important.md](important.md) and make sure to follow what it says.

- The skill we're improving is [approval-tests](output_skills/approval-tests) for python.

Once you're ready, you can analyze what's currently in the skill and make yourself a plan of how to improve it further (you can use todo tool you have you create a temporary todo file in the root), taking into account best practices of creating Claude Code skills and important considerations from context management as a guidance.

You can teach yourself more about python approvaltests by using resources in [links.md](output_skills/approval-tests/links.md)

Once you have an imporvement plan, work through it and implement until you see no more things to improve. Take your time, we're not rushing, the goal is to make it really really good.

Commit every improvement as a separate commit.

I want you to focus on thinking about what the user needs to know about this - the user is Claude Code!

Think about simplicity and also it's very important to do that exposure step by step and also I want to make sure that AI knows when to look deeper - that that deeper exists, and what it contains, and for that my understanding is to achive that the higher level docs need to mention the deeper doc with some info on what's in there. Go through everything and double check that's the case for all reference files.

Then think about other improvements we need to make, what we never thought about? What could be better? We can reconsider anything we've done before.
