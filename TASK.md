Your goal is to create the best Claude Code skill for James Shore nullables.
The best doesn't mean noisy, you need to understand how crucial is to have disclosure that optimizes Claude Code context.
It needs to follow all the good practices described in @docs folder and /Users/ladak/workspace/knowledge/skill-factory/docs/knowledge/anthropic-skill-docs

There is a lot of information and you need to devise a plan in todo_nullables.md in how you would build and improve this skill until it's perfect,
because you're unlikely to do a very good job in one go. 
Think deeply about how to approach making a really good skill given how much information there is and how important it is to have both comprehensive but also documentation that doesn't overwhelm Claude Code with all the details at once.
Make plan elements easy to check off in the markdown, then execute the plan carefully. Mark every time you finish something.
Also include all the resources you looked at and which parts of the document you're using from what at the end of the plan in a separate section.
Keep track of everything you are using and succinctly document it.

Avoid including artificial limits (like: "- [ ] Create SKILL.md (~300-400 lines)" because my worry is that you will overfocus on producing at least 300 lines no matter if they make sense or not)
So formulate guidance to reflect what we care about: context management via step-by-step exposure of more information so AI can look more things up as needed.
